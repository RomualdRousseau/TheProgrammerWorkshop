It's gone… The gem.
Stolen from my chamber
while I slept.
Oh — it's you!
I was about to send for you.
"""

MESSAGE_QUEST_GRACE_1_2 = """
Then the wind favors me today.
I came as soon as I heard.
Are you hurt?
"""

MESSAGE_QUEST_GRACE_1_3 = """
No... only my heart aches.
The gem isn't just a trinket.
It belonged to my mother.
I keep it close always.
Whoever took it must know
its value.
"""

MESSAGE_QUEST_GRACE_1_4 = """
Then I'll find them.
No matter where they hide.
I swear it on my blade...
And on my love for you.

You always say the right
things, Romuald.
But this time...
Please come back safe.
Promise me that.

Only if you promise to be
here when I return
with your gem, and your smile.

Romuald! You're hurt!
I feared...
Where's the gem?
Did you find it?

Not yet.
I tracked the thief to the
forest. Fought his men.
He escaped with the gem...
For now.
"""

MESSAGE_QUEST_GRACE_2_3 = """
Then why did you return?
"""

MESSAGE_QUEST_GRACE_2_4 = """
Because you're more
precious than any gem.
I needed to see you...
To be reminded why I fight.
"""

MESSAGE_QUEST_GRACE_2_5 = """
You reckless, beautiful fool...
You came all this way,
empty-handed, just for me?
"""

MESSAGE_QUEST_GRACE_2_6 = """
Never empty-handed.
This grows at the cliff's
edge where I last saw him.
Even there, I thought of you.
"""

MESSAGE_QUEST_GRACE_2_7 = """
Bring the gem home, Romuald...
But promise you'll come home
too.
That's the treasure I care

Is it…? Romuald?
"""

MESSAGE_QUEST_GRACE_3_2 = """
It is.
And this time,
I didn't come empty-handed.
"""

MESSAGE_QUEST_GRACE_3_3 = """
You found it...
You truly found it.
"""

MESSAGE_QUEST_GRACE_3_4 = """
It was buried deep in the forest.
But nothing could keep it
from you.
"""

MESSAGE_QUEST_GRACE_3_5 = """
You always say such things...
And yet I always believe you.
"""

MESSAGE_QUEST_GRACE_3_6 = """
Because I always return.
For you. Always.
"""

MESSAGE_QUEST_GRACE_3_7 = """
Then stay.
Not as a hero.
Not as a knight.
But as the man I love.
"""

MESSAGE_QUEST_GRACE_3_8 = """
Then let this be our new quest...
One we walk together.
